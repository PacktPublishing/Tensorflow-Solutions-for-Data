# Tensorflow Solutions for Data [Video]
This is the code repository for [Tensorflow Solutions for Data [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/tensorflow-solutions-data-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788475488), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this video you'll work with categorical data to predict loan performance. Categorical, structured data often appears in spreadsheets and relational databases, common data sources in business. This technique can be used to effectively predict performance or detect potential fraud.

You will also work with recurrent neural networks, which generate realistic test and placeholder data. This is useful to fill in systems with synthetic test data to simulate load and test the breadth of a working system andpredict one column from the others.
